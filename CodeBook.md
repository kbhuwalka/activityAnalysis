The following are the various measurements presented after analysis of the data set.

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
- Variables starting with letter 't' denote the time domain signals
- Variables starting with the letter 'f' denote the frequency domain signals

All the variables in the data set are listed below

tBodyAcc-XYZ		(3 columns)
tGravityAcc-XYZ		(3 columns)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ	(3 columns)
tBodyGyro-XYZ		(3 columns)
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ	(3 columns)
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ		(3 columns)
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ	(3 columns)
fBodyGyro-XYZ		(3 columns)
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

This gives a total of 33 variables.

The estimations made on these variables were -

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Thus the number of measurements is 66.

The first two colums are the grouping columns.

Subject: This is the identifier for the person who generated the signal
Activity: Identifies the activity performed when the signal was generated

Thus, there are a total of 68 columns in the table.
